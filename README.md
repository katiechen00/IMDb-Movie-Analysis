# IMDb-Movie-Analysis

I analyzed IMDb movie data from 2000 to 2020 using Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization. In particular, I did my analysis on answering the following questions:

* What genres are most popular each year? Do people like certain genres over time?
* What type of movie receive higher rating?
* Which genre is most profitable? What genres are associated with higher budgets?
* Which genre has the biggest return on investment (ROI)?

The final report can be found [here](https://github.com/katiechen00/IMDb-Movie-Analysis/blob/main/report/project_report.md).

The code that I used to scrape data from IMDb website can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/katiechen00/IMDb-Movie-Analysis/blob/main/imdb_data_scraper.ipynb).

The notebook that I did data cleaning, visualizations and data analysis can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/katiechen00/IMDb-Movie-Analysis/blob/main/movie_analysis.ipynb).
